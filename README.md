# Alien Invasion

This a 2D Platformer game created with Unity 2019. The project contains the compiled game as well as the solution that
can be imported into Unity. The executable file is in the /Builds/Windows/x64/Alien Invasion x64/ folder.

The game features a main menu, a main level (where the player battles against the alien invasion), an upgrade menu (where the player
can upgrade his health and speed attributes), a game over screen when player's lives reach zero and a end game menu which appears 
when the player has successfully gone through the three waves of the invasion.

This game was created by [Konstantinos Loukas](https://github.com/KostasLoukas) with the support of the Brackeys development team
(grateful for their excellent tutorial videos) and is free to use for anyone willing to expand and/or commercialize the product, 
though I will advice you to watch Brackeys' development videos and create one for yourselves (that way, it will be less like stealing
 and more like creating your own game from scratch and acquire some hands-on experience :)).

All assets included are Free-To-Use for any commercial or other use.
